This is the 1.0 version of automatic music writing based on fractal algorithms. At this stage, the coefficients for processing piano overtones are not yet perfectly selected, in the future this algorithm will be improved. The Karplus-Strong algorithm performed by the author @daivery and the synthesis of piano notes by means of sine wave processing and overlay of overtone sound by the author @Katie herzig on linkedin were taken and modified as the basis for emulating guitar sounds.


To adjust the eigenvalues and its unique sound, it is necessary to select hyperparameters in the form of an axiom for a fractal (axiom), a rule for changing the fractal (rules), the duration of the longest note (length), the number of iterations of the fractal (n_iter), the starting note in the form of an integer (note) and its interval step (step).
