In this variant, a fractal algorithm was implemented using the PyGame and MidiFile libraries, which made it possible to achieve purity of sound and fast operation of the algorithm.

To adjust the eigenvalues and its unique sound, it is necessary to select hyperparameters in the form of an axiom for a fractal (axiom), a rule for changing the fractal (rules), the duration of the longest note (length), the number of iterations of the fractal (n_iter), the starting note in the form of an integer (note) and its interval step (step).
